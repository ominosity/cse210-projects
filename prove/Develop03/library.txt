1 Nephi~|~1~|~3~|~3~|~And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.     
1 Nephi~|~1~|~1~|~1~|~I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.
